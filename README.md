🏠 California Housing Price Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
This project demonstrates how to use the K-Nearest Neighbors Regression algorithm to predict housing prices in California based on various features such as location, number of rooms, and population density. It also provides a confidence range using the neighbor prices.

📌 Project Overview
Goal: Predict median house values in California districts.

Dataset: California Housing Dataset (from sklearn.datasets)

Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor

Metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R² Score
